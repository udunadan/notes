# How to get started in vulnerability research?

... In a painfully effective way.

If someone asks me how to get started in vulnerability research, I give the same blunt advice every time:

Pick any recent **Windows kernel security update**, grab the patch diff, and try to **spot and analyze** a vulnerability in it. Then, if you can, try to write an exploit for what you found.

Brutal, narrow, and effective.

## Why this works

When you're only getting your feet on the vulnerability research ground, it's all about getting yourself dirty and experienced as soon as possible. Reading writeups is good; you will read a handful of them during your career, and as much as you are going to progress, the less writeups you are going to read. Passive activities only get you so far.

## How this works

What does researcher do? They operate around **cognitive fog** which covers the target. When you're doing 0-day research, this fog is shared by **virtually anyone** in the world, excluding a potential bug collision case. With n-day research, there is handful of people who have already worked out the vulnerability in question, and the fog is **individual**. This provides a good **simulation** of **navigating the cognitive fog of 0-day research**.

Doing N-day analysis is not the same as following a CTF write-up or reproducing an existing exploit. The big difference is simple: you don’t know whether you’re looking at a **real vulnerability** or **just noise**. That uncertainty forces you to think like a **real** researcher — to question every assumption, to trace code paths, and to validate whether a bug is actually exploitable. Compared to 0-day research, an N-day gives you a much better chance of finding something useful: someone already flagged the area as security-relevant while keeping the candidate set small and tractable. It’s a training ground where every wrong turn still teaches you something important.

Before we get to actual case study, note that our goal is still **to learn**. That makes our n-day **study** process different from **actual** research where you are supposed **to ship**. If your goal is “ship an exploit,” you’ll often fail if you're a total beginner. For this guide, it's expected. You shouldn’t start this work with the unrealistic hope that each and every attempt will succeed. Sometimes you'll face hardships and failure even if you're seasoned researcher, and that will force you to look into different bugs than you planned. The real value is the experience you gain:

- learning to read patch diffs quickly
- identifying suspicious changes and their context
- tracing execution paths in the kernel
- building small testcases and debugging crashing the target

Treat each failure like a lab result: **data**, not a **judgement on your ability**.

In the beginning was patch diffing, though.

## A case study

I will not be issuing exact instructions on how to install IDA or Ghidra, Diaphora, Bindiff, or whatever other tool used; I follow convention that mentioning a tool makes its installation instructions googlable, or at least providable by ChatGPT. For the purposes of this blog post, we'll be using [CVE-2022-34707](https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/42451423), an old use-after-free in Windows registry. This CVE is a good material to start with because the issue is already well-analyzed by its author and the proof-of-concept is provided. However, following approach outlined by my methodology, we'll not be relying on what Google Project Zero has already given to us; it would be better if you left the original description until later, **only using the CVE number itself**.

Googling for CVE-2022-34707 brings up the prelevant Microsoft Security Update Guide](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-34707) for this Windows **Kernel** Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability. We know it's a kernel we're looking into; that takes away often painful point of finding a relevant file to look for, as is the case with multiple graphics components of Windows ecosystem. The CVE is released on [9 August, 2022](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-9-2022-kb5016616-os-builds-19042-1889-19043-1889-and-19044-1889-67412989-3b5f-4443-89b4-f743382ab970), KB5016616 (using Windows 21H2 as a reference), preceded by KB5015878; this is revealed in the left column if you're willing to scroll down the support page a little bit.

Usually, [Windows patch diffing guides](https://wumb0.in/extracting-and-diffing-ms-patches-in-2020.html) take you through the process of unpacking Windows update files manually to extract the relevant files by hand. I use [Winbindex](https://winbindex.m417z.com/) to find exact KB's, so this step is skipped. Since we know that this is the kernel we're looking into, it's **ntoskrnl.exe** file that we'll be diffing. Lookup the file in Winbindex and find the mentioned KB's. This is [the patched version](https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/ntoskrnl.exe/E22246D91046000/ntoskrnl.exe), this is [the vulnerable one](https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/ntoskrnl.exe/9A263D241046000/ntoskrnl.exe). Diff them in Diaphora. Observe the interesting name **CmpCheckAndFixSecurityCellsRefcount** among the functions changed; anything that checks or fixes reference counts surely must deal with object lifetimes, and must point to a relevant security change. From there, the path for a researcher is immediately straightforward: figure out the change itself (it's a mere comparison operator fix checking that not only the smallest values are being accounted for), learn what so called security cells are, and how to trigger registry-related codepaths in the ntoskrnl.exe. More or less, all remaining information has a good description in the original P0 entry, so the author is going to leave it for an interested reader to consult it in case an attempt to write an exploit would be undertaken. It's non-trivial to choose what exactly to corrupt there and how exactly to abuse cell indexes, but that, again, is a good exercise.

## Conclusion

If you like this approach, start by picking a single Microsoft patch from the past few months and run the diff locally. Spend an afternoon mapping the changes and a week trying to trigger weird behavior. Keep notes. Share interesting findings publicly — that’s how you build credibility and learn faster. In my point of view, this is one of the fastest ways to do it.
